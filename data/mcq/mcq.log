classiﬁcation (noise or waveform) probability for each time step, and post-processing is used to precisely locate mergers.\n* The performance of the AI ensemble is quantified using the ROC curve, with a test set of 237,663 modeled waveforms covering a broad SNR range.\n* The method reduces misclassiﬁcations by combining the outputs of four AI models and calibrating the performance during training using long data segments.\n* The AI ensemble attains optimal performance with a true positive rate increasing from 0 to 0.9998 as the threshold increases from 0 to 0.9998, while the false positive rate increases from 10^6 to 10^3.\n* The code and post-processing software for the AI ensemble and gravitational wave detection are available at the DLHub.'}, {'file': 'example7.pdf', 'path':

described in the text?\n\n1) To process small datasets like Hanford and Livingston in a short period.\n2) To detect gravitational waves in real-time from various astronomical observatories.\n3) To accelerate the detection of binary black holes and binary neutron stars.\n4) To forecast the merger of binary neutron stars and neutron star-black hole systems.\n5) To process data after it has been collected.\n\n(*) 3) To accelerate the detection of binary black holes and binary neutron star.', 'answer': '3) To accelerate the detection of binary black holes and binary neutron stars.', 'text': '**\n\n- The AI ensemble achieves near-perfect scaling when distributed across the HAL cluster, allowing for the processing of large datasets such as Hanford and Livingston within 7 minutes using 16 NVIDIA V100 GPUs.\n- The AI approach delivers high sensitivity and computational performance over extended periods, making it suitable for detecting gravitational waves, particularly binary black hole mergers in real advanced LIGO data.\n- The system is currently set up for post-processing of data, but efforts are underway to extend it for streaming data using Globus. This would enable real-time analysis of data from advanced LIGO and other astronomical observatories.\n- The AI ensemble, designed for gravitational wave astrophysics, has evolved from early prototypes into sophisticated models that match the sensitivity of traditional gravitational wave detection pipelines but run faster and at a lower computational cost.\n- AI is now being used to accelerate the detection of binary black holes and binary neutron stars, and to forecast the merger of binary neutron stars and neutron star-black hole systems.\n- The authors are releasing their AI models to encourage the broader community to adopt and improve them, addressing skepticism from researchers who are not yet comfortable using AI.\n- A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrates the performance of the AI ensemble, showing its ability to detect modeled binary black hole waveforms injected in advanced LIGO noise throughout August 2017, covering a broad SNR range.'}]

Context retrieval through semantic search is a crucial aspect of LLMs, which can be extended beyond their training corpus through fine-tuning with domain-specific data or providing additional context. Fine-tuning requires significant resources and expertise, including local GPU resources or cloud compute costs, as well as expertise in language modeling, distributed training, transformers, and data curation.\n\nHowever, fine-tuning can provide the best results when sufficient data is available. Providing additional context is a cost-efficient approach, but current models have limitations on input size, making it challenging to pass in all relevant documentation. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a process that pre-processes available documentation for context retrieval, which can enhance the domain knowledge of LLMs. RAG models have shown significant improvements in various natural language processing tasks by leveraging external knowledge effectively.\n\nConversational memory is essential for LLMs to answer questions effectively, and strategies like moving windows over conversation history can help address limited context windows. This is particularly important in scenarios where the required information for generating a response is not contained within the input query alone. Research is also exploring the use of LLMs beyond text to reason about the physical world, such as in robotic tasks. This involves building design principles, including high-level robot APIs or function libraries, special prompting structures, and human feedback via text. The integration of conversational memory, context-retrieval, and specified tools creates a dynamic pre-prompt that allows LLMs to parse and respond to user input with a detailed understanding of the context behind those queries.'}, {'file': 'example1.pdf', 'path': 'example1.pdf', 'line': 1, 'chunk': 2, 'model': 'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct', 'question': 'Here is a multiple-choice question based on the augmented chunk:\n\nWhat is a key benefit of using open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) like Vicuna?\n\n1.

This is achieved by combining a Large Language Model (LLM) with conversational memory, document stores, and experimental tools. The LLM can be either a closed-source model like GPT-3.5 Turbo or an open-source model like Vicuna.\n\nGPT-3.5 Turbo is a powerful LLM developed by OpenAI, with 175 billion parameters and a context window size of up to 16,384 tokens. This allows it to process and generate text based on a large input sequence. The model's performance can be fine-tuned using parameters like temperature and top_p, which control the randomness and creativity of the output.\n\nOn the other hand, open-source LLMs like Vicuna offer a more transparent and collaborative approach to AI development. They can be modified to tailor to specific tasks and are accessible to a wider range of individuals and enterprises. HuggingFace is a platform that provides tools and resources for working with open-source LLMs, including fine-tuning and deploying ML workflows, and evaluating model performance using a leaderboard.\n\nThe use of open-source LLMs can democratize the AI community and promote AI ethical standards, such as fairness, morality, and accountability. By providing free and unrestricted access to models and information, open-source LLMs can enable more researchers, academics, and data scientists to contribute to AI development and deployment."}]

(Academic reputation systems, as stated in the text, do not have this feature.)', 'answer': '5) Explicit support for the import and export of reputation information', 'text': "* The terms centralized and distributed are commonly used to describe reputation system architectures. However, it can be difficult to determine the actual implementation of a given reputation system, particularly commercial systems that do not provide operational details.\n* For example, eBay is often cited as a centralized reputation system, but it may in fact be distributed to cope with traffic load. However, it is clear that the system has centralized governance.\n* There is a good mix of systems showing both structured and unstructured characteristics. PowerTrust employs a structured approach to reputation collection and aggregation, using a trust overlay network to model transactions and nominating trustworthy entities as power nodes.\n* Interoperability is not a common feature in academic reputation systems. Although reputation information can be freely accessed, none of the surveyed systems had explicit support for importing or exporting reputation information.\n* The control category is often overlooked due to an underlying assumption that trustworthy users are rewarded. The practice of disincentivizing entities in a reputation system is not trivial.

Here's a summary and expansion of the key points:\n\n- The SSX technique uses a bright synchrotron beam and specialized apparatus to collect diffraction data from many crystals, producing higher quality data than conventional crystallography due to reduced radiation damage.\n\n- In an SSX experiment at APS Sector 19, around 40,000 16-bit pixel images per sample are generated, with tens of samples processed during a beamtime. These images are processed with the DIALS and PRIME packages to identify crystal lattices and solve the crystal structure.\n\n- Three distinct flows are involved in the SSX process: SSX-Stills, SSX-Prime, and SSX-Publish.\n\n  - SSX-Stills transfers a batch of acquired images to a computing facility, performs quality analysis, identifies hits, generates visualizations, and transfers results back to the beamline.\n\n  - SSX-Prime uses diffractions from SSX-Stills to solve the crystal structure.\n\n  - SSX-Publish publishes results obtained to date, plus derived data such as histograms, to a repository and catalog.\n\n- These flows are initiated by a local agent deployed at the instrument that monitors the creation of files.\n\n- Ptychography is a coherent diffraction imaging technique that can image samples with sub-20 nm resolutions. It involves scanning a sample with overlapping beam positions while collecting far-field diffraction patterns.\n\n- The Ptycho flow performs 2D inversion and phase retrieval on diffraction patterns, comprising three steps: transferring data from the experimental facility to a computing facility, processing each diffraction pattern, and transferring intermediate results back to the experimental facility.\n\n- During a ptychography experiment, hundreds of instances of this flow can be initiated concurrently. It can also be extended with 3D reconstruction steps and science-specific AI/ML methods for feature segmentation, event or phenomena detection, and experimental steering.\n\n- Next-generation detectors will have readout speeds of more than 100 kHz and increased pixel counts, resulting in multi-PB datasets. ML-based methods for phase retrieval can achieve speedups of tens to thousands of times, opening the door to real-time imaging and automated experiment steering, but the ML model must be retrained for each new material."}, {'file': 'example10.pdf', 'path': 'example10.pdf', 'line': 1, 'chunk': 11, 'model': 'mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3', 'question': 'Question: Which of the following concepts is used for fast X-ray Bragg peak analysis in the text?\n\n1) Lossy Compression for Floating-Point Data *(*)\n2) Near Real-Time Remote Search\n3) Tomographic Reconstruction\n4) Parallel Ptychographic Reconstruction\n5) Design Patterns', 'answer': '4) Parallel Ptychographic Reconstruction', 'text': '**\n\n* The text discusses various aspects of research process automation, particularly in the field of scientific data analysis and imaging.\n\n1. **Research Process Automation:** The text discusses the automation of research processes across various domains, focusing on scientific data analysis and imaging.\n\n2. **Globus for Scientific Instruments:** Globus is a platform used for managing and moving data for scientific instruments.

However, high-accuracy methods like G4MP2 are computationally expensive, limiting their widespread use. To address this, researchers developed machine learning models that can predict high-accuracy energies from faster, but less accurate calculations (B3LYP). This approach, known as Δ-learning, involves training models to learn the differences between B3LYP- and G4MP2-level calculations.\n\nThe resulting models, available in DLHub, can predict G4MP2-level molecular atomization energies with an accuracy of around 10 meV, which is comparable to the uncertainty in experimental data. This capability can be scaled up or down depending on demand, making it possible to quickly estimate high-fidelity atomization energies for hundreds of molecules per second.\n\nThe use of machine learning models in materials science can greatly accelerate the discovery and design of new materials. By making these models available in DLHub, researchers can access them without needing to install software, promoting collaboration and advancing the field. The elastic scalability of the models also enables researchers to handle large datasets and complex calculations, further accelerating the materials discovery process.\n\nThe development of these machine learning models is part of a broader effort to create a materials data ecosystem that supports the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence methods. This ecosystem includes capabilities such as automation of data sharing, enrichment of data with metadata, and a library of curated machine learning models and processing logic. By providing these capabilities as services, researchers can access powerful tools and resources without needing to develop them from scratch, accelerating the pace of materials discovery and design.'}, {'file': 'example4.pdf', 'path': 'example4.pdf', 'line': 1, 'chunk': 8, 'model': 'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct', 'question': 'Here is the multiple-choice question based on the augmented chunk:\n\nWhat is the primary advantage of combining machine learning with quantum chemistry in predicting molecular properties?\n\n1.

It enables more accurate and efficient predictions of molecular properties.', 'text': '**Summary in Bullet Points:**\n\n* Researchers have developed machine learning models to predict accurate atomization energies of organic molecules from low-fidelity quantum chemical calculations.\n* A deep learning architecture called SchNet has been proposed for molecules and materials.\n* The Δ-machine learning approach combines big data with quantum chemistry approximations to improve predictions.\n\n**Expanded Summary:**\n\nThe three research papers mentioned in the chunk are all related to the application of machine learning techniques to quantum chemistry and materials science. The first paper by Ward et al. demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms to correct errors in low-fidelity quantum chemical calculations, enabling the prediction of accurate atomization energies of organic molecules. This is a significant advancement, as high-fidelity calculations can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.\n\nThe second paper by Schütt et al. introduces SchNet, a deep learning architecture specifically designed for molecules and materials. SchNet is a neural network that can learn complex relationships between molecular structures and their properties, allowing for accurate predictions of various molecular properties.\n\nThe third paper by Ramakrishnan et al. presents the Δ-machine learning approach, which combines large datasets with quantum chemistry approximations to improve the accuracy of predictions. This approach leverages the strengths of both machine learning and quantum chemistry to provide more accurate and efficient predictions of molecular properties.\n\nThese papers collectively demonstrate the growing interest and progress in applying machine learning techniques to quantum chemistry and materials science. By combining machine learning with quantum chemistry, researchers can develop more accurate and efficient methods for predicting molecular properties, which can have significant implications for fields such as drug discovery, materials design, and energy storage.'}, {'file': 'example4.pdf', 'path': 'example4.pdf', 'line': 1, 'chunk': 4, 'model': 'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct', 'question': 'Here is a multiple-choice question based on the augmented_chunk:\n\nWhat is the primary purpose of the "describe" capability in DLHub?\n\n1.

To package servables in a way that is portable across different computing resources', 'answer': 'To specify models, code, and data to create a servable and provide metadata', 'text': '**Summary in Bullet Points:**\n\n* DLHub capabilities:\n\t+ Describe: specify models, code, and data to create a servable and provide metadata\n\t+ Publish: send files and metadata to DLHub to create and register a servable\n\t+ Discover: search the catalog to find interesting servables and learn how to use them\n\t+ Run: execute a servable on input data on DLHub-provided computing infrastructure\n* Access to DLHub capabilities through:\n\t+ DLHub SDK\n\t+ REST API\n\t+ Command Line Interface (CLI)\n* DLHub service components:\n\t+ Cloud-hosted DLHub service\n\t+ Cloud-hosted servable creation service\n\t+ Cloud-hosted metadata catalog\n\t+ Servable execution environments (e.g., cloud resources, Kubernetes clusters, high-performance computing systems)\n\n**Expanded Summary:**\n\nThe DLHub service and SDK provide four key capabilities for researchers to work with servables: describe, publish, discover, and run. The describe capability allows researchers to specify the necessary information to create a servable, including models, code, and data, as well as metadata such as author names and input types. This information is used to create a servable that can be discovered and used by other researchers.\n\nThe publish capability enables researchers to send the necessary files and metadata to DLHub, which then creates and registers the servable in the servable catalog. The discover capability allows researchers to search the catalog to find servables that match their needs, and learn how to use them. Finally, the run capability enables researchers to execute a servable on input data using DLHub-provided computing infrastructure.\n\nDLHub provides access to these capabilities through three interfaces: the DLHub SDK, a REST API, and a Command Line Interface (CLI). This allows researchers to interact with DLHub in a way that is most convenient for them.\n\nThe DLHub service is designed to support these capabilities with high availability, scalability, security, and performance. To achieve this, the service is composed of multiple components, including a cloud-hosted DLHub service, a cloud-hosted servable creation service, a cloud-hosted metadata catalog, and potentially many servable execution environments. These components work together to provide a scalable and secure environment for creating, discovering, and executing servables.\n\nDLHub uses containerization technology, such as Docker or Singularity, to package servables in a way that is portable across different computing resources. This allows servables to be executed in a sandboxed environment, which improves security and reliability. Additionally, DLHub uses Parsl to manage scalable computing resources, which enables the service to deploy servable containers on provisioned nodes or cloud instances and set up high-performance connections between the DLHub service and the deployed servable.'}]

The evaluation metrics used include relevance, truthfulness, and completeness of the responses.\n\nThe results show that without context retrieval, both models tend to hallucinate and provide irrelevant answers.

This configuration allowed for efficient multithreaded execution on each node, with Tensorflow inference tasks grouped into batches of 4096.\n\nThe application\'s performance was evaluated from two perspectives: computational performance (efficiency) and the quality of the results obtained. The evaluation showed near 100% utilization for most of a 1024-node run, indicating that the application was able to efficiently utilize the available computational resources.\n\nHowever, two major sources of under-utilization were identified: startup time for inference Workers and simulation tasks that do not complete within the timescale of the job. The startup time for inference Workers can be reduced by unpacking Python libraries to node-local memory before launching Parsl Workers, as suggested in [26]. The under-utilization due to simulation tasks not completing within the timescale of the job can be mitigated by periodically checkpointing simulation tasks or by splitting simulation tasks into smaller steps.\n\nThe application\'s performance was maintained by periodically checkpointing simulation tasks or by splitting simulation tasks into smaller steps. This approach allows the Thinker to use intermediate results to decide whether the computation should be continued, reducing the overhead due to communication.\n\nThe evaluation also showed that the overheads due to communication are minimal for QC-Assay tasks, with the median cost for launching a new simulation being 1015 ms. The communication cost of the ML-Assay tasks is partly hidden by prefetching tasks to Workers, but two issues were identified that lower utilization and could inhibit further scaling: the startup time for the Workers used for ML assays and the time required to compile a TensorFlow model before execution.\n\nTo improve scaling in the future, the Thinker application could consider Worker start-up costs when allocating resources, such as maintaining a smaller number of nodes dedicated to the ML-Assay tasks to leverage the benefits of "warmed" nodes for inference tasks. Additionally, optimizing the communication of large results and requests could further improve the application\'s performance.'}, {'file': 'example1.pdf', 'path': 'example1.pdf', 'line': 1, 'chunk': 3, 'model': 'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct', 'question': 'Here is the multiple-choice question based on the augmented_chunk:\n\nWhat is a key use case for Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be extended beyond their training corpus?\n\n1.

The authors are trying to optimize the process of evaluating a large set of entities (e.g., molecules) with respect to certain properties (e.g., ionization potential) using a limited set of resources (e.g., computational power).\n\nThe key challenges in this problem are:\n\n1. **Exploration-exploitation tradeoff**: The authors need to balance the need to explore new entities and assays to gather more information with the need to exploit the existing knowledge to optimize the scoring function.\n2. **Resource allocation**: The authors need to allocate the limited resources (e.g., computational power) efficiently to maximize the expected gain in knowledge or optimization of the scoring function.\n3. **Uncertainty and accuracy**: The assays have different costs and accuracy characteristics, which introduces uncertainty in the estimation of properties. The authors need to account for this uncertainty when making decisions.\n\nThe use of learned assays, such as machine learning models, adds an additional layer of complexity to the problem. These models can be improved by retraining on new data, but this requires additional resources and introduces new tradeoffs.\n\nThe generator function, which introduces new candidate entities based on the current record, can be seen as a way to explore the vast space of possible entities efficiently. This is particularly useful when the number of entities is large or even innumerable.\n\nThe decision problem is formulated as a sequential process, where the system state is captured by the sets of known entities, associated data, and assays. The authors need to choose the next action at each step, considering the current system state and the available resources.\n\nThe application of this framework to electrolyte design for next-generation batteries is a great example of how this problem formulation can be applied to real-world problems. The use of quantum chemistry simulations and machine learning models as assays demonstrates the potential of this approach to integrate multiple sources of information and optimize complex systems.'}]

Unlike previous approaches that focus on cost optimization or bidding strategies, D/r.scAFTS prioritizes providing reliability guarantees to users. This is particularly important in cloud computing, where instances can be terminated or revoked at any time, leading to downtime and loss of data.\n\nThe authors' non-parametric approach is notable, as it does not rely on assumptions about the underlying distribution of spot prices. This makes D/r.scAFTS more robust and adaptable to changing market conditions. The inclusion of change-point detection and autocorrelation compensation features also enables the method to handle complex price histories and autocorrelated data.\n\nOne of the key advantages of D/r.scAFTS is its ability to provide predictive bounds for arbitrary future durations. This allows users to plan and budget for their cloud computing resources more effectively, reducing the risk of unexpected terminations or revocations.\n\nThe authors' comparison to previous works highlights the novelty of their approach. While other methods focus on minimizing costs or predicting spot prices, D/r.scAFTS provides a probabilistic guarantee of instance durability.

It reduces the time spent on simulations by 5%.\n2. It increases the success rate of identifying high-value simulations to 0.5%.\n3. It performs significantly better than selecting molecules at random.(*)\n4. It eliminates the need for dedicating specific resources to ML tasks.\n5. It optimizes the partitioning of resources between simulation and learning tasks.', 'answer': '3', 'text': '**Summary in Bullet Points:**\n\n* The performance of the molecular design application is assessed by studying the scores of molecules over a run.\n* The application uses machine learning (ML) models to select molecules for quantum chemistry (QC) simulations.\n* Two versions of the application are compared: one that retrains the ML model on-demand during the run and one that only trains once at the beginning of the run.\n* The results show that using ML models to select molecules performs significantly better than selecting molecules at random.\n* Retraining the ML model during the run leads to an improved ability to identify high-value simulations.\n* The application provides reasonable response times between when a simulation completes and its data are used to select the next simulations.\n* The challenge is to perform model updates quickly, and dedicating specific resources to ML tasks is necessary to keep up with the rate of data production.\n* The work demonstrates the benefits of online training of ML models and opens up opportunities for evaluating adaptive experimental design on high-performance computing (HPC) systems.\n\n**Expanded Summary:**\n\nThe molecular design application uses machine learning models to prioritize the order in which molecules are considered for QC simulations. The results show that this approach significantly outperforms random selection, with a success rate of 78% and 64% for the runs with and without retraining, respectively, compared to 0.5% for the random agent. The application that retrains the ML model during the run finds 10% more molecules with large ionization potentials, even though it spends 5% less time on simulations.\n\nThe benefits of active learning are most pronounced at the end of the run, where the application uses data from the largest number of previous simulations to select new inputs. The average ionization potential of the application with retraining is significantly higher than the run without retraining, illustrating the improved ability to identify high-value simulations.\n\nThe challenge in using ML models for molecular design is to perform model updates quickly, as the simulation data are produced rapidly. The application provides reasonable response times, with an average of 57 minutes between when a simulation completes and the task list is updated based on its results. However, dedicating specific resources to ML tasks is necessary to keep up with the rate of data production.\n\nThe work demonstrates the benefits of online training of ML models and opens up opportunities for evaluating adaptive experimental design on HPC systems. For example, asynchronous, batched active learning strategies can be used to optimize the partitioning of resources between simulation and learning tasks. The Colmena application provides a starting point for innovating new algorithms to steer ensemble simulations on HPC.\n\nAdditionally, the component evaluation section discusses the optimization of large result transfers, which is a major source of communication costs. The inclusion of a Value Server reduces the requirement of serialization and deserialization of task data, leading to performance improvements in both synthetic and real-world production runs.'}, {'file': 'example5.pdf', 'path': 'example5.pdf', 'line': 1, 'chunk': 11, 'model': 'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct', 'question': 'Here is a multiple-choice question based on the augmented_chunk:\n\nWhat is a primary focus of the research papers referenced in the text?\n\n1.

Non-competitive: A non-competitive inhibitor binds to an enzyme at a site other than the active site, causing a change in the enzyme's conformation that affects the substrate binding affinity, without directly competing for the active site.\n\n2. Uncompetitive: An uncompetitive inhibitor binds to the enzyme-substrate complex, formed after the substrate has already bound to the active site. This inhibition mechanism reduces the enzyme's maximum reaction velocity (Vmax).\n\n3. Competitive: A competitive inhibitor binds to the active site of the enzyme, preventing the substrate from binding, thus reducing the reaction velocity.\n\n4. Allosteric: An allosteric inhibitor binds to a site other than the active site, causing a conformational change that alters the enzyme's active site structure, reducing the substrate binding affinity or enzyme activity.\n\n5. Irreversible: An irreversible inhibitor forms a covalent bond with the enzyme, permanently deactivating it."}]
